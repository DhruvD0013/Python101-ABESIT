Day3 Assignment- The assignment is focused on making you familiar with the functions and usage of data types.

1. Try to write your own equivalent implementation of print function from scratch.

(
Hints: print "write" whatever it needs to write on stdout.
stdout is available through
import sys
sys.stdout

in a file we can write using

file.write("string that we need to write into the file") 
)

print signature is-

print(*objects, end='\n', sep=' ', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)


BONUS- Try to Google about flushing a data stream and try to implement flush functionality in print as well. (Pat yourself on the back if you implement it completely)



2. Try to implement range function.

(
Hints: internally range is a generator that yields +1 value each time you call it while the value is less than n with increment equal to step.
)

3. isdigit() gives false if a string is in float
Create a method isfloat(string_argument)
That takes an argument as a string and returns True if the string argument is float else returns False.
