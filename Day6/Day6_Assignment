Day5 Assignment- 

1. Implement Fraction class.

Think about data modelling.
You need to implement basic mathematical operations (USING FUNCTIONS NOT OPERATOR OVERRIDING) between two fractions.

eg. 1/2 + 1/2 = 1/1
1/2 - 1/2 = 0
3/4 *3/4 = 9/16
(3/4) / (3/4) = 1/1

2. Write the disassembled code of the Fraction Class's object to a file.

3. Read about json format. Download Check JSON.
Read the file directly as json using 

import json
json.load method.

see help(json.load) to understand what parameters to give.
